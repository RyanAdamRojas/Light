Apps I like:

Photomath: 
    1. The ability to transcribe handwritten math problems into text (probably LaTeX via Image Recognition and Machine Learning) and it makes me feel empowered
    2. Once the image is transcribed, its instantly solved and steps are available for view which has been very helpful in college
    3. The app serves a single funciton and has a simple business model, much like how apple has three apps, each for music, podcasts, and books while spotify has all three in a single bloated app.
Waking Up: 
    1. This apps notifications are intentially desined to interupt your day with mindful reminders and I find that creative
    2. Has a very tasteful UI and consistant visual themes of "clouds" as "thoughts"
      
ChatGPT:
    1. The "circle" motif is creative. The circle bounces around the screen as text is generated using the iPhones haptics which is very satisfying to watch.
    2. The app serves a single function and has a clear business model
    
Apple Music:
    1. The Live lyrics feature is animated beautifully as apposed to Spotifys execution.
    2. The Sing-Along feature uses ML and is almost seamless 

Apple Weather: 
    1. The way weather conditions are animated dynamically to accuratley represent IRL weather 
    2. The way the app completley relies on The Weather Channels API is impressive. (Apple Maps as well)
